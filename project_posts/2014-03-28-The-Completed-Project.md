##Portraiture ReImagined - For Gallery Installation & Online G+ Users

The Final code is up and our work is done....


## Gallery Installation
We now have a Generative Portrait that interacts with gallery visitors and expresses the concept of the "Observer Effect" by tracking their head movement and altering it's compostion.

Whether it be Presidential portratits or other classical portraits, I see this project as a series of between 3 to 6 compositions.

I see this work displayed on a series of large monitors in a gallery space, for visiotrs to interact with up close, and passively from a distance.


Again, the footage of the responsive portrait in action...

## Online G+ User Version
We also now have an online version for use by G+ users that takes the face detected in their profile image, and blends it with the static SVG portrait prodcued for the exhibition.
