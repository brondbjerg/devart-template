There were really 2 seed ideas behind this "Portraiture Reimagined" project:

1) Give digital artwork greater depth and a more painterly feel by sampling the colour and composition of classical portraits.

2) What is is the output like if you keep drawing triangles (or polygons) from the last mouse positions and sample the average colour of the last 2 two.
