# Portraiture Reimagined

## Background
Digital design is often created and consumed on-screen and can be clinical and lacking serendipity. I wanted to create work that draws from analogue sources and so, this project started as an investigation into colour and composition sampling from existing classical portraits and landscapes.

This is a project I had already begun, with my series of static portraits of "Dead Presidents".
It was featured recently on the Artists & Algorists blog: [Read Article](http://artistsandalgorists.com/dead-presidents/ "Link to article").

I have also written about the process behind my drawing algorithm here using Processing & Porcessing.js here: [Read Post](http://www.brondbjerg.co.uk/blog/2014/02/generative-portraits-with-processing-js/ "Link to post").

For openness & consistency, I'll be covering these first steps in the project in my posts below and then moving on to new development specifically for the DevArt project.

## Proposal
For the DevArt project I would like to take my initial generative portraiture work to the next stage.

I propose exhibiting Reimagined Portraits (if possible) opposite the original classical portraits in a gallery setting.

Reimagined Portraits will be displayed on life size displays / projections and move beyond static artwork and start introducing randomised / algorithmic motion.

I'm keen to explore interaction (both real world and virtual) between the exhibition visitor and artwork.
Of particular interest is the idea of the "Observer Effect" [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect "Link to article"), which refers to "changes that the act of observation will make on a phenomenon being observed".

I will investigate how the Reimagined Portraits could be changed by the observer, perhaps by: proximity, observer's image, head orientation, viewing position, number of viewers, sound, movement or even the observer's online presence (for example their social profile picture or account preferences).

An online exhibition could open the artwork to web users who could collectively contribute their image to the work. 
Image averaging (of viewer's images) would be a nice techinique to use to influence the evolved output of the reimagined portrait.


## Processing.js Prototype
I have created a web based processing.js prototype of the initial drawing algorithm:
The prototype uses the Google Data Arts UI controls to allow you to adjust the various drawing parameters.
