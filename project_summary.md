# Portraiture Reimagined

## Description
Digital design is often created and consumed on-screen and can be clinical and lacking serendipity. I wanted to create work that draws from analogue sources and so, this project started as an investigation into colour and composition sampling from existing classical portraits and landscapes.

This is a project I had already begun, with my series of static portraits of "Dead Presidents".
It was featured recently on the Artists & Algorists blog: [Read Article](http://artistsandalgorists.com/dead-presidents/ "Link to article")
